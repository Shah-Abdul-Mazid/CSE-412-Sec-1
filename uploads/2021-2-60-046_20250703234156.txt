Good Morning, Mam! This is Shah Abdul Mazid from the CSE department, your student in CSE 412. Just wanted to send you a warm hello and say how excited I am to be in your class!  Your teaching makes coding so much fun, and I’m looking forward to learning tons this semester. Wishing you a wonderful day!
